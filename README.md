# hello-world
my first github repository that i will use to learn the platform

A bit about myself, as easy as this question always sounds, it is a bit difficult to answer because, the question just requires you to just write something honest and true about yourself, but we tend to over think it and end up writing lies or things that we feel that will impress the person or people who this question is requested from.
Well i am a very honest person, that believes that if you want something, you need to put the work in, i also believe that i can learn anything i put my time and effort into, because our brains are only limited by our own laziness, i could go on and write a book, but i really need to continue learning this platform,
